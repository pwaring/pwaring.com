        <p>I'm a freelance IT consultant based in Greater Manchester. As well as the <a href="/services/">services I offer</a>, I'm also interested in a non-executive position with a business or charity which could benefit from my technical and commercial skills, having served on several boards in the past.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I run <a href="http://www.currybeer.com">Currybeer</a> and <a href="http://www.geekwalks.co.uk">Geek Walks</a>, edit the <a href="http://www.flossuk.org/">FLOSS UK</a> newsletter, and act as treasurer and webmaster for the <a href="http://www.manchesterca.org.uk">Manchester Classical Association</a>. I'm also a regular attendee at <a href="http://www.manlug.org" target="_blank">ManLUG</a> and have given <a href="http://www.phpdeveloper.org.uk/talks/">talks</a> on a variety of subjects.</p>
