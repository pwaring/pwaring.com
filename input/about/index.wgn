----
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve been a freelance web designer/hoster and programmer and I still perform some pieces of contract work. I&#8217;ve been working with web design, hosting and programming in a professional capacity since 2000.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a professional member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology.</p>
<p>I have also served on a number of boards, including <a href="https://www.directfleetinsurance.co.uk">Direct Fleet Insurance</a>, <a href="http://www.ukuug.org" target="_blank">UKUUG</a> (now <a href="http://www.flossuk.org">FLOSS UK</a>) and <a href="http://www.merci.org.uk" target="_blank">MERCi</a>.</p>
