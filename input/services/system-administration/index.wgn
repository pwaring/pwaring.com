title: System Administration
----
<p>Do you have a number of servers which need maintaining, but canâ€™t justify a full time member of staff to look after them? For a small monthly fee (dependent on how complex your setup is), I can take over the management of your servers, keeping them up to date with your requirements. I work exclusively with Linux systems.</p>

<p>I can also help create scripts which will automate common tasks, such as downloading and installing system updates.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
