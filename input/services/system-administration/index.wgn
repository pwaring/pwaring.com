title: System Administration
----
<p>Do you have a number of servers which need maintaining, but cannot justify a full time member of staff to look after them? For a monthly fee, I can take over the management of your servers, keeping the system software and other applications (e.g. WordPress) up to date. I work exclusively with Linux systems, using Ansible for configuration management and Git for version control.</p>

<p>I can also assist with server migration and train staff on configuration management if you would prefer to keep system administration in-house.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
